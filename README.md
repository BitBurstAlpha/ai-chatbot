# AI Customer Assistant Chatbot with Integrated Ticketing

## Brief Description

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven customer service chatbot integrated with a ticketing system. It leverages machine learning models (e.g., TensorFlow with BERT/GPT) for natural language processing, offering scalable, intelligent, and personalized customer support. The chatbot handles real-time queries, escalates unresolved issues through ticketing, and provides insights via an analytics dashboard.
